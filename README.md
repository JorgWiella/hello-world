# hello-world
my first repo
Jorg Wiella here, (well my intended pseudonym was JÃ¶rg Wiella since it would be the Germanisation of my Mexican name, which Germans always have trouble saying, and since now my life is in Germany I tought that at least for some areas of work I would use this pseudonym) I enjoy working on different front end projects, I will be focusing on the MEAN stack to develop most of my projects, because I think being well-versed on JavaScript has more of a future in the marketplace, as opposed to PHP.
